The system aims to streamline library processes by enabling effective management of book inventory, monitoring patron activities, and generating insightful reports, all while ensuring data integrity and security through well-defined SQL queries and constraints.  

**Key Activities:**

Database Design and Schema Creation: Design the database schema, including tables for books, patrons, transactions, and staff, and establish relationships between these entities.

Data Entry and Management: Develop and implement procedures for entering, updating, and maintaining data related to books, patrons, and library transactions.

Query Development: Write and optimize SQL queries to support various functionalities such as book searches, patron records retrieval, transaction history, and report generation.
